# Career development and learning log

This is a log of my learning and development activities. This log will be semi-formal and ordered descending by date. This is an effort to both track my learning progress, as well as to make use of Git for all of my development learning activities. There are a lot of topics I need to get up to speed on but using Git will help organize my learning. I recently bought a new laptop dedicated to these activities. This will allow me to be more mobile and also attend tech conferences and events. In the Fall of 2016 I started taking classes at MCTC with the initial goal of acquiring their C# Development certificate. While keeping my goals relatively small and incremental, I do aspire to attain a degree in software development.
